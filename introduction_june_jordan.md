##### Introduction: June Jordan and the "Every Where, of Any Place"

One would think the image on the map is one out of a sci-fi story.
Here we see the Harlem landscape riddled with fifteen enormous conical buildings
that look like alien structures if one doesn’t mistake them for the cooling
towers of nuclear plants. Standing tall and differing much from the conventional
skyscrapers we see in Manhattan, let alone the six-story tenement housing,
it is hard to predict that this speculative sketch is in fact an urban
environmental design proposal that sought to combat social degradation.

Interpretation of the style of such structures aside, “Skyrise for Harlem”
is an environmental redesign imagined by June Jordan, in collaboration with
architect R. Buckminster Fuller, to better and expand the life of Black Harlem residents.[^1]
Jordan, who is better known for her activist writing and poetry, was compelled
to learn and engage with architecture after the Harlem Riots of 1964. In
“Letter to R. Buckminster Fuller,” June Jordan urges a theory of place in
relation to human being: “I hope that we may implicitly instruct the reader
in the comprehensive impact of every Where, of any place.” For Jordan, place
was an important determinator that dictated the lived lives of its inhabitants.
Jordan thus set out to imagine a new space and place for Harlem residents –
one where residents control their own quality of life – with a worried eye
to the history of urban renewal as the removal of Black people from neighborhoods
through eviction and the higher rents effectuated by redevelopment. “Skyrise for
Harlem” was an architectural vision to intervene in the structures and systems
that neglected and negatively affected the livelihoods of Harlem residents.
Jordan, as writer activist, created a future imaginative that could capture
what Rob Nixon robustly explicates through the term “slow violence.”

Though Jordan eyed the future, with “Skyrise for Harlem,” the violence that
prompted her proposal is a slow and imperceptible one. In *Slow Violence and
the Environmentalism of the Poor*, Nixon discusses the violence set by environmental
destruction as one that is attritional, postponed, invisible, and ignored.
The harm of toxic buildup, deforestation, and the accumulation of greenhouse gases
do indeed have delayed effects and evidently are of planetary scale as we see with climate change.
With no event to necessarily spectacularly mark this violence, Nixon examines
writer activists, including Jordan, as amplifiers who face the “representational,
narrative, and strategic challenges” of such a violence that principally harms
those lacking resources.[^2] Jordan’s project, which centers the importance of place,
speaks additionally to the structural violence of racism and poverty that "requires exorcism."[^3]

<!-- Jordan’s philosophy of place further takes shape into a transnational environmental
activism in “A Poem About Vieques, Puerto Rico,” where she explicitly refers
to environmental degradation. Sitting in a hotel bar, the speaker of the poem
asks the bartender if in the paradise “where sugarcane and pineapples/ and locust
trees and mango and…soursop/acacia palm/ and lusciously gardenias/amaropa/bougainvillea/
grew so beautiful” would he “expect to find the river gullies/ dried down to the
dustbone of the earth/ and all the grass turned into tinderstuff?” In naming
the Caribbean flora and fauna that might be lost as a consequence of dried out
rivers and grass, indicating that true paradise is in the environment’s abundance,
not the tourist resort where Jordan finds the bartender. Jordan’s comment on the
environmental degradation finds imperialism culprit, as it is the U.S. Navy and
Marines’ bombing of the beach waters that throws flora and fauna into extinction
and moreover excludes the Puerto Rican people from their own land as indicated
by the opening of the poem’s meditation on a “ “The Ocean Is Closed on Mondays”
sign. Evidently, for Jordan, the environmental, built and natural, justice
was entangled in the racial, economic, and social justice she fought for in
through her activism and political writing [Alston, 2005]. -->

Following Jordan, I seek to highlight the entanglement of environmental,
racial, economic, and social conditions and its connection to spaces and places by
conducting a visualization and analysis of geospatial urban data of New York City.
As Nixon's discussion of “slow violence” alarms, to capture the
violence and then hope for justice as a result of the complex and imperceptible
threats of environmental destruction, deregulation, and social and economic
policy proves difficult. I choose the map because it provides a way to
represent this narrative in a spatial way, which resonates with the
emphasis of remodeling of space and place to change life experience as presented by Jordan.
Environmental factors that affect human life vary over location, thus shedding a light on the
spatial and geographic relationships between environmental conditions and
populations is essential in understanding the “slow violence” spurred by
economic development and harmful urban planning policy.

<!-- <p>
  Maps and geographical information systems are tools wrought with power.
  Although I am enlivened by the representational possibilities of mapping,
  I am cautious of the stories maps make visible and those that are rendered
   invisible. And mapping certainly has a history of repressing narratives.
   Cartography has a history of white European domination and imperialism,
   where other populations’ senses of place are “concealed by what might be
   called rational spatial colonization and domination” (McKittrick, 2006).
   It is thus important to note that the geographic analysis pursued in this
   project is executed on a Western conception of mapping which has chiefly
   been used to record land and resources for conquest and exploitation.
   Furthermore, as Gieseking emphasizes by way of Kaplan, the contemporary
   geographic information systems software that has greatly enhanced spatial
   analysis has been created as military technology and now is used to advance
   surveillance capitalist ventures. This history not lost to me, however in
   the field of DH, mapping projects have critically wielded GIS to promote
   social justice (“Mapping Inequality,” “Torn Apart / Separados”) and
   amplify histories lost when looking solely at textual records
   (“Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761,” “In the Same Boats”).

“Instant Slum Clearance” when published in the magazine. Jordan notes that the <i>Esquire</i> heavily credited the project to Fuller and referred to it as "a utopian plan."
