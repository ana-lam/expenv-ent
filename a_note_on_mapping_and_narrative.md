##### A Note on Mapping and Narrative

Now, why a map to try and represent the nearly irrepresentable notion of "slow violence?"
And even more, why maps, a tool wrought with power? Although I am enlivened by the representational
possibilities of mapping, I am conscious of the stories maps make visible and those
that are rendered invisible. Cartography has a history of white European domination
and imperialism, where other populations' senses of place are "concealed by what might
be called rational spatial colonization and domination."[^1] I want to note that the geographic
data visualization pursued in this digital scholarship project is executed on a
Western conception of mapping which has chiefly been used to record land and resources
for conquest and exploitation. The data points and layers on these maps cannot convey
the experiences of the many lives lived and then transformed into a quantitative element.

As Gieseking emphasizes by way of Kaplan, the contemporary geographic information systems software
that has greatly enhanced spatial analyses has been created as military technology and now is pursued
to advance surveillance capitalist ventures.[^2] This history is not lost to me, however in the field
of DH, mapping project have critically wielded GIS to promote social justice scholarship, as in
[*Mapping Inequality*](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58) and
[*Torn Apart / Separados*](https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/2/).[^3][^4]

"Things fidget/ Even history...the landscape does not sit willingly as if
behind an easel holding pose," Kei Miller cautions to the mapmaker.[^5] My project is an alternative data visualization tool. A map but not just a map, because
the landscape of "slow violence" doesn't sit still. Black studies and cultural geography scholar Katherine McKittrick argues that Black women's geographies and poetics express that "humanly workable geographies are continually being lived, expressed, and imagined."[^6] Jordan forces us to look at Harlem and understand that the spatial environment
changes, and when changed to match our imagination, can transform life. My map is just not a map. It is an exploration into narrative and data that believes that emphasizing how location is tied to unequal life experiences, engendered by social and civil processes, is a step in reworking and imagining the built and lived environment of New York City.
