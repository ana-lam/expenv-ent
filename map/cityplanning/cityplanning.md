#### City Planning Data

Though Midtown Manhattan and Downtown Manhattan has drastically negative air quality due to fine particulate matter, neighborhoods in the outer parts of Brooklyn and Queens along with my three areas of interest – South Bronx, Sunset Park, and Williamsburg-Greenpoint – fall under the higher end of fine particulate matter accumulation, ozone accumulation, and heat vulnerability.

**Manufacturing Districts (M3)**

M3 districts are areas with heavy industries that generate noise, traffic, or pollutants. M3 districts are generally near the waterfront and are suggested to be buffered from residential areas. Many M3 districts host power plants, solid waste transfer facilities, recycling plants, and fuel supply depots.
