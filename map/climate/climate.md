#### Climate Data

Though Midtown Manhattan and Downtown Manhattan has drastically negative air quality due to fine particulate matter, neighborhoods in the outer parts of Brooklyn and Queens along with my three areas of interest – South Bronx, Sunset Park, and Williamsburg-Greenpoint – fall under the higher end of fine particulate matter accumulation, ozone accumulation, and heat vulnerability.   

##### About the Data

**Air Quality - Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)**

The mean mcg per cubic meter of fine particulate matter is an Air Quality Index indicator. Fine particulate matter includes particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller. These can be found in smoke and haze, and are generally emitted by vehicles, building boilers, and other types of combustion. This particulate matter is a major component of air pollution that harms health.

**Air Quality - Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)**

Ground level ozone (Ozone) is a three oxygen molecule created by a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds catalyzed by sunlight. In Earth's lower atmosphere, ozone levels are considered dangerous because motor vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions help form that ozone. Smog is mainly made out of ground-level ozone. The combination of hot weather and sunlight create harmful amounts of ground-level ozone.

**Heat Vulnerability Index**

The Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) accounts for temperature, green space, access to air conditioning, and poverty levels to indicate neighborhoods whose residents are more at risk for extreme heat related death. Developed by the NYC Health Department and Columbia University, the HVI aims to summarize most important factors determining harmful health effects during times of extreme heat.
