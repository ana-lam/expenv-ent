#### Demographic Data

The cumulative exposure risks of city planning - industrial sites, waste facilities, traffic – are largely higher in my areas of interest – South Bronx, Sunset Park, and Williamsburg-Greenpoint – which are also locations of predominately low-income communities of color.  

##### About the Data

**Percent of Population Near or Below Poverty Line**

The percent of population near or below poverty line is disproportionately higher in the areas of environmental interest such as South Bronx. The districts with higher percent also coincide with districts of high surface day temperature during the summer.  

NYC Government’s poverty measure differs from the official poverty measure by accounting for pre-tax cash, the effect of income and payroll taxes, and the value of in-kind nutritional and housing assistance. The threshold line is also adjusted to reflect the high cost of housing in New York City.
