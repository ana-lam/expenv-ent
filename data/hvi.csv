Indicator Name: Heat Vulnerability Index,,,,,,,
Indicator Description: <p><span>The New York City (NYC) Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) is a measure of how the risk of heat-related illness or death differs across neighborhoods. Neighborhood risk factors that increase heat- vulnerability in NYC are: less home air conditioning less green space hotter surface temperatures and more residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black. Differences in these risk factors across neighborhoods are rooted in past and present racism.&nbsp;</span></p>,,,,,,,

Name:Heat Vulnerability Index,Measure:Score (Lowest 1  -  Highest 5),How Calculated:<p>Each neighborhood receives a score from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk) based on a statistical model that uses social and environmental factors to estimate risk of heat-related death across NYC neighborhoods.&nbsp;<strong>A low vulnerability score does not mean no risk</strong>.&nbsp;Every neighborhood has residents at risk for heat illness and death. Residents who are at highest heat risk are those who do not have or use air conditioning&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;are older or have chronic health conditions or serious mental illnesses.</p>,,,,,
