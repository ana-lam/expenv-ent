In supplementing the DHC's environmental justice and sustainability focus, I want to create or manipulate knowledge in a manner that will leave users/readers/interactors feeling as if environmental justice is accessible, not as if action and opinion is relegated to climate scientists or does that study environmental scholarship. Furthermore, I know that I want my project to have a local community scope, in the sense that the knowledge and information is readily relevant to those in the Columbia community. My greatest source of inspiration is [Torn Apart/Separados](https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/1/), Dr. Gil's data visualization intervention to US immigration policy and ICE presence with Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research.

  
**Notes/Questions:**

* Interdisciplinary, after all it's the digital humanities, so consider science, humanities, social science, and technology
    * I am very interested in mapping, representing data in a way that emphasizes space and place

<br/> 

* *Glocal* approach, I want to focus on a local problem because there is where the knowledge could be the most active (what will those who interact with this project be able to do? I want to empower them in some way)
    * "We might begin by asking ourselves at what point did we become overly invested in the digital to the exclusion of pressing social issues of racial injustice, disenfranchisement, and community transformation. Is the narrow, inwardly focused attention on institutionalizing digital humanities to the exclusion of the social, political, and economic landscape worth it? What are the boundaries that we will consider in our collective engagements?" [^1]

<br/>

* I have an affinity for literary scholarship, how can I transfer what I have learned, doing postcolonial criticism, to this project?

* WE ACT for Environmental Justice: West Harlem Environmental Justice Organization, currently involved in policy action for urban heat amelioration
    * I listened to interviews, digested their website for my interview project on urban heat

<br/>

* Thinking beyond archival processes, the archive important of course, but as Noble suggests, lets refocus on materialism 
    * Initially I did want to do an archive dive, but the archive is limited. What does an archive of the present look like? I know this means dipping my toes possibly in social media data

<br/>

* "We also need to rethink how we formulate our models. Instead of first asking what can be modeled—what phenomena we can track at scale—we might instead ask: what might be hidden in this corpus? And are there methods we might use to bring out significant texts, or clusters of words, that the eye cannot see?" [^4]
    * EJScreen (EPA's Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool), not easy to use, not everything is explicit. 
    * Make things simple, pretty, and easy to use. I, for one, do not feel comfortable or at ease using EJScreen

<br/>

**Some DH concepts/projects:**
* *operationalizing* [^2] representing knowledge in a form that is machine use ready 
* *distant reading* [^3] primacy of secondary sources (statistics and so on), in opposition to close reading, kind of like context-reading 
* [Radicalizing the Digital Humanities: Reimagining Environmental Justice Research and Teaching](https://radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu/ojs/radicalteacher/article/view/395/293).

* [June Jordan and Buckminster Fuller talk about land use, working with students, solar and wind power projects, geodesic domes, etc.](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/archival_objects/1622420)

* [Practicing environmental data justice: From DataRescue to Data
Together](http://lindseyldillon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Walker_et_al-2018-Geo_Geography_and_Environment.pdf)

* Cindi Katz (CUNY) , Vernice Miller-Travis (We ACT)

**Research Question:**
* My research question broadly is: How can I deliver this knowledge and information about current and local environmental policy to the public?

**Methods you will pursue:**

Tech wise:
* Leaflet, ArcGIS
* JavaScript (love the opportunity to learn)
* Use Python, Pandas for data management

Research wise:
* Combing through open source data
* Reach out to WEACT and other local env orgs

**What do you imagine the final project or deliverable of this DH project will be?** 
* So I'm very enthralled by Dr. Gil and Dr. de Sa Pereira's nimble tents digital projects framework
