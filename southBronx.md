##### Fighting FreshDirect: South Bronx's struggle for environmental and economic justice

<br>

In 2018 headlines, the Mott Haven neighborhood in the South Bronx was described as the last "battle line" between the internet food-delivery giants FreshDirect and AmazonFresh. Despite significant community opposition, the largely minority and low-income neighborhood became the un-consenting prize awarded to FreshDirect in the form of a 400,00 square-foot facility on St Ann's Avenue.

Situated between the Major Deegan and the Bruckner Expressway, Mott Haven now suffers significantly higher-trafficked thoroughfares in an area that already had the highest asthma-related emergency hospital visits in the city. As a neighborhood now defined as a center of industry, Mott Haven continuously finds itself caught in the wake of cars and trucks riding the multiple highways, releasing particulates into the air resulting in significantly increased air pollution. In fact, Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health reported an undeniable increase in black carbon air pollution in Mott Haven in 2020 following the opening of the FreshDirect warehouse.

The city's neglect of the South Bronx is not a recent development - in the 1970's the Bronx suffered a drawn-out period of disinvestment and urban decay. That decade saw a housing crises and HUD and city policies that failed the Bronx's largely minority communities. The legacy of redlining also left its imprints as banks and insurance companies stayed away from the borough due to the race-based discriminatory practices of the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1930s. This redlining, along with the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway, brought on irrevocably decreased property values.

The city's move to subsidize the construction and opening of a delivery warehouse only exacerbated the public health concerns related to air quality in the Bronx. Today, the South Bronx's waterfront has developed into a significant industrial area. Despite having a large portion of its perimeter touch water, little of the South Bronx's waterfront is for community use or residential use. The waterfront areas of Hunts Point and Mott Haven are mainly designated as M3 districts (manufacturing districts with heavy industries) which include the new FreshDirect warehouse and the Hunts Point Cooperative Market. The high concentration of industrial activity in these would-be economic oases result in a higher aggregate release of noxious particulates into the air. Deliberate city planning designed a high concentration of industrial activity and increased traffic density in the Bronx, knowingly contributing to the environmental degradation in the borough with the highest percent minority population and percent of residents near or below NYCgov poverty threshold. This disproportionate deterioration of the environmental safety of these minority and low-income communities has led the South Bronx to become the epicenter of new asthma cases in the city.

FreshDirect, with city politics at its aid, is enacting something akin to "corporate colonialism" in the South Bronx. FreshDirect's primary consumer base resides in Manhattan, where the percent of the population near or in poverty is much lower.

South Bronx Unite, a coalition of South Bronx residents, organizations, and allies, campaigned against FreshDirect when the city subsidized its construction plan without community input. Using the language of environmental and economic justice, South Bronx Unite took aim at the exacerbation of asthma rates imminent with FreshDirect's diesel trucking operation under its mission to improve and protect the environmental and economic future of the South Bronx.
