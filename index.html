       <h2>THE PROJECT <a href="about.html">></a></h2>
       <p>
       [Title] is a quantitative geospatial narrative. This project draws upon NYCOpenData to visualize environmental data along urban demographics and built environment of NYC.
       Diving into the multiple datasets provided by the city, there is a lack of contextualization that facilitates a critical understanding of this quantitative data. This project
       aims to act as an alternative data visualization tool that centers critical inquiry of its construction and ideological ends alongside examining and contextualizing local urban
       environmental data. The relationship between location and environmental conditions reveals disparities across the boroughs of NYC which, with the additional analysis of social and
       economic status of these communities, presents evidence of the structures that engender these harmful inequities. In my work on investigating environmental injustice in NYC, I
       follow the spirit of the field of Digital Humanities to utilize digital tools to not only expand my humanistic inquiry into the history of local environmental politics,
       but to also connect historical and social awareness to the environmental datasets provided by NYC agencies.

        This webtool allows one to view multiple layers of information concerning the environmental conditions present in urban NYC.
        The ability to view historical and social layers of data prompts readers and viewers to consider the relationship between
        the built environment and the social conditions of NYC.
